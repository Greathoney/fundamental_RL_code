# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction in Python

This repository contains the code for the book [📕Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Sutton and Barto. The code is written in Python.

I have reorganized the code that I understood at a high level. It is concise and easy to understand, which will make it easier for people who are new to reinforcement learning to follow along and hopefully gain more understanding. If you find my repository helpful or like it, please give it a star⭐!

Please note that this is unverified code. And feedback is always welcome.😁
